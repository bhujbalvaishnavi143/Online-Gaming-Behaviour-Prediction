# Online-Gaming-Behaviour-Prediction
•	Developed a player engagement prediction model using Random Forest Classifier to classify gaming behaviour.
•	Pre-processed data by encoding categorical features, normalizing numerical variables, and handling missing values for improved model accuracy.
•	Optimized hyperparameters using Randomized Search CV, enhancing model performance to 91% accuracy.
•	Evaluated model robustness using classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
